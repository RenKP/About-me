# About-me
just some basic info


my name is ren kp ( will not share actual name for privacy reasons )

i am 17 years old, born in august

my interests are : naruto, jujutsu kaisen, sonic the hedgehog, the honkai game series (guns girl z, honkai impact: 3RD, honkai: star rail)

i have autism (asperger syndrome), i know "aspergers" is an outdated term, but it is what i was diagnosed with by a doctor, i can't socialize very well and i am really bad at starting conversations,
i might seem like a dry messager/texter because sometimes i don't know what to say, but as long as i get comfortable i can match people's energy

since i'm 17, i would prefer that the people i int with are between 15-19
i don't want to befriend anyone 13 or under/20 or over, i feel i can related more to people my age and talking to younger people as a 17 year old makes me uncomfortable

my favourite character oat is sai (i think that's obvious), i've loved him since i first saw him in the anime and i love him to this day
